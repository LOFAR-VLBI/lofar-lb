# lofar-lb
This repository contains Python scripts for the LOFAR long-baseline pipeline. Most are ancestors of parts of the existing pipeline, but there are some utility functions (e.g. for plotting closure), imaging/selfcal (loop3) and an attempt to use closure quantities to generate models (model_engine).
